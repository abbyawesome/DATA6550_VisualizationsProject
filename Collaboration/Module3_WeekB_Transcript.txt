Alrighty. How goes it? I think we're good. I think we're just accept some changes. Right?

I'm glad you guys are doing that. I'm glad you guys are doing cleanup. Oh, this is the smallest thing in the world. It's just, like, my brain has to do this. Charles, if you would you be okay if you put your graph before your words?

Just yeah. Just go ahead and do it. Cool. Yeah. I I yeah.

I I That was my one thing. I was like It's out of sync with the others, isn't it? I I kinda knew that and meant to change it and just didn't do it. I also noticed that, and I didn't I gotta just let it go. But No.

It's the most nitpicky nothing suggestion. I'm sorry. Now listen. Anything that makes it better and more consistent for sure. You want me to change it?

I'll do it right now. Oh, I I already did it. Okay. I I just I didn't see it yet. Perfect.

Yeah. That one ready. Cool. So I think we're pretty good on the report. We'll just need to go through and accept everything.

But then, Steven, can you add the summaries to the GitHub? Oh, yes. I was planning on doing, both of them after I was, after we were done, with this last call. Sounds good. But, yeah, I mean, I feel like the biggest thing is just our final checkup.

And, I mean, so far, everyone's work looks great. So Yeah. Yeah. You're right, Abby. It does look better, by the way.

And it it's just such a small thing. But Alright. So, Abby, are you just going through and accepting these changes? That would be fine with me. Yeah.

I'm just gonna go through and click them all. Yep. I don't have to keep on the call. I'm just gonna click until it helps. Okay.

Yeah. There's a little bit of a delay, so I'm not keeping up with you. But I trust whatever you're doing and anything else that you wanna change. You are fully commissioned to to do it. Is there anything else that we need to talk about?

Is everyone's stuff in GitHub? I I posted my final notebook earlier today, and then I'm gonna be, uploading the collaboration things, once we're done here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

I don't think I Oh, sorry. Yeah. Go ahead. Just make sure in your code, it has the little summaries about why each visual is good or bad. That was one of the things he asked for.

Oh, yeah. I can I'll add that. I'll go back and add that. Okay. So let me just let me just sort of test my understanding.

I've I put a bunch of visuals in mine. Like, I've got eight or 10 or 12 because I was just starting and seeing what I liked and didn't like. Can I just highlight the one I used? Or or did he want them all? Did he want them all annotated?

No. I would just do a couple for both good and bad just because he asked for two, but I don't think he need to do more than that. Okay. Alright. Well, then I'll make changes to my notebook, and I'll get it pushed tonight.

Yeah. I'll try to get it done. I'll try to get mine pushed e it'll most likely be tomorrow morning for me, if that's okay. No. I think as long as it's in the GitHub before tomorrow at midnight, like, it doesn't affect the report or anything.

So we could kinda Oh, okay. Add it in. Oh, yeah. That's right. You're sure right.

Alrighty. So who's gonna wrap this up? Who's gonna No. I can turn in the report once I get all of this through. K.

That'd be that'd be great. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for doing that. Thanks, Abby.

Yeah. No worries. Alright. So wow. We're we're kinda done.

Yeah. Alright. I still go back every day and read the site just because I think I'm missing something, but I feel that. No. I think this week's a little easier because this weekend is the data dive for all the, like, short classes.

Mhmm. And, like, you know, Not next week, but the week after is spring break. So I'm guessing that's why this week's a little lighter. Yeah. Yeah.

Perfect. Makes perfect sense. Yeah. I hope we needed it to be easy this week. Alright.

So, we just get this all wrapped up by tomorrow midnight, which is, like, a no brainer, and then we don't have a reading assignment or quiz. Is that all? Really? Yeah. K.

I think so. Perfect. Well, it seems too good to be true. It makes me nervous, but heck. On Friday, I'll try and look at whenever it opens up the stuff for next module so we can get assigned who does what for that.

Yeah. Good for everyone. Good idea. Sounds good. K.

Alright. Anything else we need to do tonight? I can't think of anything else. Too sure. Abby, thank you for getting us across the finish line.

Yeah. No worries. Alright. Bye, everybody. See you.

See you.
